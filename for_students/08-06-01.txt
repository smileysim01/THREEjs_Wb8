Please describe the buildings you created in this file 08-06-01.txt
Building 1: Pyramid Hip
Building 2: Shed

Explain how you made the buildings. 
For both the buildings I made separate materials for different textures for the 4 base walls and roofs.
Then I added unique textures to roofs of both buildings.
For base, I used the house texture provided for adding doors and windows.
For roof of building 1, I used UV_Grid_Sm.jpg provided.
For roof of building 2, I downloaded a shed tiled texture from the web and used it.
All the geometries are built from scratch using BufferGeometry only.
