Please describe the vehicles you created and how you made them in this file 08-07-01.txt
I made a car which is more like a Mumbai Taxi.
Used textures for tyres, windows, and the matte car body.
I used different geometries for each part of the vehicle from scratch.
I used Three.js documentation for geometries.
My favorite part: Tyres
